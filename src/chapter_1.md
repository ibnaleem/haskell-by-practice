# Functions

What makes Haskell a unique language is its requirement of functions; unlike other languages where you can declare variables and classes, Haskell forces you to use pure functions that must return a value to compile. We will explore exercises related to the I/O paradigm in Haskell in the I/O Chapter. For now, complete the following exercises.

## Exercise 1:
Complete this function that should return the double of its argument:
```haskell
double_me :: Int -> Int
double_me x = ?
```
There are **2** solutions to this exercise.
