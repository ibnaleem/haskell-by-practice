# Haskell Syntax

## Functions
Creating functions:
```haskell
myfunc x = x + 1
```
Functions are declared with an `=` sign; there aren't any keywords to declare variables such as `def`, `const`, etc. 

Arguments are declared after naming the function. These are seperated with spaces:
```haskell
myfunc x y z = x + y + z
```

## Pattern Matching
