# Prerequisites
Unlike imperative programming languages, [Haskell By Practice](https://github.com/ibnaleem/haskell-by-practice) assumes you have *some* knowledge in imperative programming. The following prerequisites are required and will not be explained in this book:

- Datatypes, especially lists and tuples 
- Functions

Loops, classes, inheritance, are not included in Haskell; therefore, you are only expected to know what strings, integers, lists, and tuples are, as well as functions and how you call them.

Knowledge of Haskell syntax is a plus, but not required since this book aims to teach it to you through exercises.
